            	MANILA, Philippines - Along with being the DSWD's ambassador for poor children, Venus Raj is also the newest ambassador for TINGOG 2015 - a citizens feedback-focused campaign of the United Nations Philippines, launched in Tabaco City, Albay.<br /><br />

                With the cooperation of the local government and the NGO Social Watch Philippines, the campaign is first ever in the Southeast Asia after India and Kenya (in Africa).<br /><br />
                
                TINGOG 2015 is an integrated SMS and online citizen feedback initiative supported by Social Watch Philippines and the United Nations Millennium Campaign (UNMC).<br /><br />
                
                The global citizen feedback initiative was a product of the 2010 Millennium Development Goals (MDG) Summit in New York, where world leaders agreed that accelerating achievement of the MDGs required ensuring transparency and accountability, and citizen involvement in social development.<br /><br />
                
                The initiative aims to use information and communications technology to empower citizens to report on delivery of services and expect timely response from local governments.<br /><br />
                
                Growing up in poor condition, Venus absolutely recognizes the value of this campaign. She emphasized that other important needs of the family can be addressed by the good cause of TINGOGGOGGOG as an efficient medium of communicating health issues and problems.<br /><br />
                
                Venus explains in an interview, "Sobrang laking tulong. Kapag magsasaka ka lang and then 'yong asawa mo ay simpleng housewife lang, hindi mo na iisipin 'yong pambitamina ng mga anak mo. Ang iisipin mo, 'yong kakainin nila araw-araw, iyong basic needs ng mga anak mo. At least kung mayroong mga ganitong proyekto, sila na 'yong sasalo sa iba pang pangangailangan."<br /><br />
                
                The MDGs are time-bound, concrete and specific goals that 189 world leaders committed to achieving by 2015 at the United Nations Summit in September 2000. These goals are: 1) end extreme poverty and hunger; 2) achieve universal primary education; 3) promote gender equality and empower women; 4) reduce child mortality; 5) improve maternal health; 6) combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; 7) ensure environmental sustainability and 8) develop a global partnership for development. For the Tabaco pilot, however, TINGOG 2015 will focus on delivery of services related to MDGs 4, 5 and 6, specifically on HIV/AIDS.

            	I'm honored to be the spokesperson for Tingog 2015, a program that aims to improve government services in local development planning by providing a platform for citizens to send direct and immediate feedback to their respective local government officials.<br /><br />

                We launched it in Tabaco City, Albay last Oct. 17. It was a day marked with a renewed sense of commitment in helping improve the lives of people.<br /><br />
                
                Aptly dubbed Tingog, the project emphasizes the value of the citizen's input in improving their community. Tingog is a Bicolano term meaning voice. By listening to the concerned constituents themselves, any project would be more efficient in addressing the needs of the people. It also improves community relationships because it emphasizes the value of open communication channels.<br /><br />
                
                Tingog is a Citizen Monitoring and Tracking (CMT) system that aims to ensure delivery of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) services at the grassroots by allowing citizens to report on and monitor such services through the use of short messaging system (SMS). The project will be implemented in partnership with the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and the country's three leading telecommunication companies: Smart Communications, Globe Telecom and Sun Cellular.<br /><br />
                
                Citizens could text their reports, complaints or any feedback to a four-digit access code, 2015, using any mobile phone or carrier.<br /><br />
                
                By text messaging, the project makes it easy for people to be active in community affairs. It encourages involvement among the people and government. This initiative has potential and I hope that it is sustained by public support. We are finally given the chance to say something, to be heard, and more importantly, to be listened to. We should take advantage of this privilege.<br /><br />
                
                Mothers and children joined our Solidarity Walk and interacting with them was such a fulfilling experience. Their enthusiasm for life was infectious and their willingness to work with their governments was very encouraging.<br /><br />
                
                It was refreshing to see the cooperative spirit between the citizens and their government officials. Hopefully, this commences a relationship that overlooks political animosities and instead champions the value of the quality of life we can provide our people.<br /><br />
                
                Attended by DILG Sec. Jesse Robredo and World Health Organization Country Rep. Dr. Soe Nyunt-U, the launch was a big event indeed. It was a fitting start to a project that aims to have an even bigger impact on others' lives.<br /><br />
                
                It is my fervent prayer that the initial public interest would translate to consistent involvement. Let us all support and be a part of this worthwhile endeavor.

            	The city of Tabaco in Albay recently unveiled a SMS and online citizen feedback initiative that allow citizens to report on delivery of services and expect timely response from local governments.<br /><br />

                The project, dubbed Tingog 2015, is the country's answer to the global initiative to enable citizen feedback on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), its proponents said.<br /><br />
                
                The initiative is named Tingog 2015 to signify its objective of giving "voice" to the people on matters relating to social development ("tingog") and its goal of accelerating achievement of the MDGs in time for the deadline in the year 2015.<br /><br />
                
                The first of its kind in the Philippines, Tingog 2015 is a technology platform that empowers citizens to send direct feedback to local government agencies via SMS and receive responses on their feedback from concerned local government agencies.<br /><br />
                
                The initiative empowers ordinary citizens to inform local government agencies when services are not being delivered, as well as provide positive feedback when social needs are being satisfactorily met. The feedback gathered will also be used by local government to ensure responsiveness in development planning.<br /><br />
                
                The global citizen feedback initiative was a product of the 2010 MDG Summit in New York, where world leaders agreed that accelerating achievement of the MDGs required ensuring transparency and accountability, and citizen involvement in social development.<br /><br />

                These goals are: 1) end extreme poverty and hunger; 2) achieve universal primary education; 3) promote gender equality and empower women; 4) reduce child mortality; 5) improve maternal health; 6) combat HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases; 7) ensure environmental sustainability, and 8.) develop a global partnership for development.<br /><br />
                
                For the Tabaco pilot, however, Tingog 2015 will focus on delivery of services related to MDGs 4, 5, and 6, specifically on HIV/Aids.<br /><br />
                
                Prior to the Albay launch of Tingog 2015, the global citizen feedback initiative has only been launched in Kenya, Africa, and in India.<br /><br />
                
                Mobile operators Globe, Smart, and Sun Cellular are also working to make available the four-digit number "2015" to be the official Tingog 2015 number for sending citizen feedback.<br /><br />
                
                After the Tabaco City pilot, the initiative is intended to be rolled out across the Philippines to empower citizens to participate in local governance, social development and the achievement of the MDGs.<br /><br />
                
                Among those who attended its recent launch were Tabaco City mayor Krisel Lagman-Luistro, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) secretary Jesse Robredo, Binibining Pilipinas-Universe 2010 and Ms. Universe 2010 fourth runner-up Ma. Venus Raj, both of whom hail from Bicol.<br /><br />
                
                Also present during the event were Dr. Soe Nyunt-U, country representative of the World Health Organization; Jessica Cantos, Social Watch Philippines co-convenor and chief of staff of House deputy speaker Lorenzo R.

            	Miss Universe 2010 4th runner-up Venus Raj joins hands with United Nations Philippines as she becomes the newest ambassador for TINGOG 2015, a campaign centered on citizens' feedback recently launched in Tabaco, Albay. The Philippines is the first country in Southeast Asia to implement these measures, with the help of the United Nations Millenium Campaign (UNMC) and non-government organization Social Watch Philippines.<br /><br />

                Using SMS and online feedback, TINGOG 2015 intends to encourage transparency in government by giving citizens the power to report the response time for delivering essential services from local government units. The campaign focuses on ensuring that services relating to three Millennium Development Goals established by UNMC in New York are efficient and in place by 2015. The goals are to reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, and combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.<br /><br />
                
                Venus, who grew up in poverty, says TINGOG is a great way of relaying citizens' problems, especially in terms of health. "Sobrang laking tulong. Kapag magsasaka ka lang and then 'yong asawa mo ay simpleng housewife lang, hindi mo na iisipin 'yong pambitamina ng mga anak mo. Ang iisipin mo, 'yong kakainin nila araw-araw, iyong basic needs ng mga anak mo. At least kung mayroong mga ganitong proyekto, sila na 'yong sasalo sa iba pang pangangailangan. (This is a big help. If you're just a farmer and your partner is just a simple housewife, you don't think about what to set aside for your kids' vitamins. What's on your mind is what they'll eat every day, what basic needs they have. At least with projects like this one, someone else will take care of these extra needs.)"<br /><br />
                
                The beauty queen was present at a Solidarity Walk at the Tabaco City Terrace on October 18, along with more than 1,200 campaign participants.
